## 🧩 Game Rules

1. Each player (human and computer) rolls **5 dice**.
2. Players can choose to **re-roll** unselected dice up to **3 times per round**.
3. At the end of a round, each player's dice values are summed and added to their total score.
4. The first player to reach or exceed the **target score** (default: 101) wins.
5. If both reach the score in the same round, a **tie-breaker** occurs.
6. The computer uses different strategies based on the game state:
   - Aggressive: when behind in score
   - Conservative: when close to winning
   - Final push: when last chance to reach the target
